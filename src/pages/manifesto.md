# Open Language Foundation Manifesto

We, the members of the Open Language Foundation, are united in our pursuit to advance technology for the localization industry. We are committed to the enablement of seamless communication across diverse cultures and languages.

Through our actions, we embrace these six principles:

- **Collaboration over Silos:** We believe in the power of collective intelligence. We encourage active collaboration among language enthusiasts, developers, and experts to foster innovation and drive positive change within the localization and internationalization community.

- **Interoperability for Unity:** We recognize that effective global communication demands systems that can seamlessly interoperate. To foster inclusivity and shared understanding, we prioritize the development of technologies that bridge gaps and guarantee smooth interactions between different tools and platforms.

- **Standards for Consistency:** We acknowledge the importance of standards to achieve consistent quality. We advocate for the establishment and adoption of robust industry standards that promote best practices, efficiency, and reliability in localization operations.

- **Open Knowledge for Empowerment:** We cultivate the democratization of knowledge. We promote the free exchange of information, insights, and resources that empower individuals and organizations to excel in localization and internationalization.

- **Open-Source for Accessibility:** We champion open-source technology. Creation and support of open-source tools and solutions enable widespread access to cutting-edge resources. It drives innovation and equal opportunities for all stakeholders.

- **Convention over Configuration:** We value streamlined processes. We embrace convention over configuration to reduce complexities, minimize decision fatigue, and enhance the efficiency of localization workflows.

Through these principles, we are dedicated to fostering an environment where technology amplifies the impact of localization and internationalization efforts. We celebrate diversity, inclusivity, and the boundless potential of technology to transcend linguistic and cultural boundaries. Our commitment to these values guides us as we pave the way for a more interconnected and harmonious global community.
